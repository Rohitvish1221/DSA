/* TCS NQT Coding Question – 12
Problem Statement – Given an array of integers and a sum, the task is to count all subsets of given array with sum equal to given sum.
Input: The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the array. The next line contains space separated integers forming the array. The last line contains the sum.
Output: Count all the subsets of given array with sum equal to given sum.
NOTE: Since the result can be very large, print the value modulo 109+7.
Constraints: 1<=T<=100 1<=n<=103
1<=a[i]<=103
1<=sum<=103
Example : Input : 2
6
2 3 5 6 8 10
10
5
1 2 3 4 5
10
Output :
3
3
Explanation :
Testcase 1: possible subsets : (2,3,5) , (2,8) and (10)
Testcase 2: possible subsets : (1,2,3,4) , (2,3,5) and (1,4,5) */
